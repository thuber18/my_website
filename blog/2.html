    <h1>Blog from December 15, 2020</h1>
    <p>
      I'm still considering what to make my blog about. In the meadtime I will just post 
      some things that I find interesting. Today, I watched a good TEDx talk by Jennifer Cohen
      about getting what you want in life and not settling for what is "on the memnu".
      Here is the clip:

    <iframe 
      width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wM82hE6oimw" 
      frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" 
      allowfullscreen>
    </iframe>
    <p>
      Here are the main takeaways:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>BE BOLD</li>
      <li>Don't have self doubt</li>
      <li>Practice failing</li>
      <li>Chase what you want</li>
      <li>Don't settle for what you get</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The action item that <a href="https://jennifercohen.com/">Jennifer Cohen</a> gave was
      to write down what you want most in life and then make at least 10 attempts to get it.
